# community-structure-metabolic
analysis of metabolic-state induced changes in community structure of individual's functional brain network

This repository holds the code necessary for analysis on MyConnectome Project's data centering on the community structure and the fed/caffeinated vs. fasted/uncaffeinated states.

aatotal_data_analysis_flow.m is a script that runs through all necessary steps for analaysis and figures.

Running the code relies on several libraries that are assumed to exist in the folder above. See the "addpath" statements in aatotal_data_analysis_flow.m.
